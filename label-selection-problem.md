- potential label candidates are filtered by having a DM (else, tokens for example could trigger false negatives) 
  -> could cause problems because of tight coupling to current architecture ideas


DiaGen: 
 - creating a transition prompts you to enter a corresponding label for it. Label and GO a bound to each other
 - not handling the problem at all (probably greedy behavior)
