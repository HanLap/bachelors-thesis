\label{ch:conclusion}

This work presented an experimental architecture that can be used to define modeling syntax configurations for \textsc{CouchEdit}. To this end, the approach of Fondement and Baar \cite{fondement_making_2005} was adapted and extended to fit the needs of the \textsc{CouchEdit} architecture.
