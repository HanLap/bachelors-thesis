\chapter{Evaluation}

possible criteria
\begin{itemize}
  \item lines of code
  \item complexity
  \item performance
\end{itemize}

\section{Applicability}
metamodel is TGG + hypergraph deckt alles von Bottoni ab -> Metamodel kann in theory jeden modeling syntax konfigurieren

\begin{itemize}
  \item in terms of complexity, was shown that correct plugin design is important
\end{itemize}


\section{Performance}
To reduce complexity, Annotation



Nachreiner showed in his work \cite{nachreiner_couchedit_2020} that 



\begin{itemize}
  \item ordered Processing seems applicable (core processors first, then plugins, etc.)
  \item way more processing -> performance loss
  \item plugin processor needed for specialized tasks
  \item plugins need to to be well designed (to specialized\\
        and is general applicability drops,badly designed config model and its a hassle to use )
\end{itemize}
